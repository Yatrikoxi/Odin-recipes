    <h2>How to make Wiener Schnitzel</h2>
    <p>Wiener schnitzel means <em>"Viennese cutlet"</em> in German,<br>
     and it is one of Austria's most traditional and representative dishes.<br>
     So much so, in fact, that its definition is fiercely protected<br>
    by Austrian law. It must be made of veal;<br>
    when made with any other type of meat,<br>
    it <u>cannot</u> technically be called <strong>Wiener schnitzel.</strong></p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 veal cutlets</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all.purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Salt and black pepper</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Oil or lard, for frying</li>
        <li>4 slices of lemon- garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap,<br>
         and use a heavy, flat-surfaced pan,<br>
         rollling pin or meat mallet to pound the meat<br>
         evenly to 1/4-inch thickness.</li><br>
        <li>To bread the schnitzels, set up 3 shallow dishes:<br>
            Mix the flour and salt in the first dish,<br>
            the beaten eggs in the second dish,<br>
            and the breadcrumbs in the third dish.
        </li><br>
        <li>In a large skillet,<br>
            heat at least 1/4-inch of oil to 350 F.<br>
            This takes about 8 minutes and the oil<br>
            will just start to shimmer and smoke a bit.</li><br>
        <li>Working one at a time,<br>
            dredge cutlets first in flour<br>
            until the surface is completely dry.</li><br>
        <li>Dip in egg to coat,<br>
            allow the excess to drip off for a few seconds.</li><br>
        <li>Then roll quickly in the breadcrumbs until coated.<br>
            Do not press the breadcrumbs into the meat,<br>
            as this will moisten them and not make for a crispy coating.<br>
            The crust should not adhere completely but form a loose shell<br>
            around the schnitzel.</li><br>
        <li>Immediately place meat in the pan with the hot oil.<br>
            Do not crowd the pan. Cook the schnitzel in batches,<br>
            if necessary. Fry the schnitzel for 2 to 3 minutes<br>
            on one side, until golden brown. Make sure the breaded meat “swims”<br>
            in fat. Contrary to instinct, the breading will take on less oil<br>
            than if the meat is sticking to the pan.<br>
            Also, the breadcrumb topping has a chance to puff up a little,<br>
            and your cleanup is easier.<br>
            You may want to swish them around a little with your fork<br>
            to make sure they are not sticking to the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Turn them over once and fry an additional 2 to 3 minutes<br>
            or until both sides are golden brown and the meat registers<br>
            an internal temperature of 145 F.<br>
            Remove from pan and allow the oil to drain off.<br>
            Serve in the traditional manner with lemon slices.</li><br>
    </ol>
